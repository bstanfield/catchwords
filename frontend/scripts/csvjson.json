Now, 12 years later, there are over 3M electric vehicles on the road globally, with more being produced every day. The auto industry is moving towards electrification, and governments around the world have recognized the harmful impact of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle emissions and have started to take concrete steps towards making the future more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Since then, Tesla has launched countless products that have succeeded in the early adopter market, with more recent additions like the Cybertruck and Solar Roof aimed at the mainstream. Over 550K Tesla vehicles have been sold, and they have driven over 10B miles to date, resulting in a combined savings of over 4M metric tons of CO2.",

    "notes": "Their products are powered by Ripptein, their proprietary pea-based protein. Unlike almonds, which require irrigation; or cattle, which contribute to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions; peas have a small environmental footprint. With water scarcity taken into account, growing almonds requires 100 times as much water per ton of crop as dry peas. Dairy milk requires 25 times more water per liter of milk than Ripple. Yellow peas grow in areas that receive lots of rain, so they need little or no irrigation. Ripple�s bottles are also made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic; and that plastic can be recycled by 94% of US households. Their website site has a real time counter that documents its \"Ripple Effect.\" Their carbon impact is impressive (60M lbs saved), but their water impact even more so (186B gallons!). Most recently, Ripple was awarded a grant by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop sustainable, high protein food options for people in the developing world.",
